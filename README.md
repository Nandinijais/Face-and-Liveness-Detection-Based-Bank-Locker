# Face-and-Liveness-Detection-Based-Bank-Locker
Source Code for the project

# Overview
Face and Liveliness Detection-Based Bank Locker System is a Python-based intelligent security application designed to provide high-level authentication for bank lockers.
Instead of relying on traditional PINs or cards, the system verifies a user using facial recognition and real-time liveliness detection (blink and motion analysis) to ensure that only a real, authorized person can access the locker.
This project aims to eliminate risks like photo spoofing, video attacks, and unauthorized access, making bank locker systems more secure, reliable, and future-ready.

# Acknowledgments
This project, “Face and Liveliness Detection-Based Bank Locker System,” was created by Nandini Jaiswal as part of her Undergraduate final-year project. It was inspired by the growing need for stronger, smarter security systems in the banking sector where traditional authentication methods are no longer sufficient.
Special thanks to the open-source community and the developers of tools and libraries such as Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask, and face recognition frameworks, which made it possible to build a real-time, AI-driven biometric authentication system.
I also thank my faculty mentors and peers for their guidance, feedback, and support throughout the development of this project.
